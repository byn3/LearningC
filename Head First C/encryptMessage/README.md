open command line
type this in
gcc message_hider.c encrypt.c -o message_hider
that made a exe file named message_hider

AFTER .exe exists,
now type message_hider and hit enter. now it runs in the command line.
type whatever and it will XOR the bits 31.
you can also do message_hider < test.txt to give it an input file
